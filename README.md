</div>

The software architecture consists of a Flask API that processes incoming sensor data and a Flutter application that serves as the user interface.

### 3.2 Integration of Hardware and Software Components
The system integrates hardware sensors with software components through communication protocols like HTTP and APIs.

### 3.3 Communication Protocols
Data is transmitted using standard HTTP requests between the Flutter app and the Flask API.

## 4. Data Flow

### 4.1 Data Collection
Sensor data is collected in real-time and sent to the ThingSpeak platform for initial storage.

### 4.2 Transmission to Flask API
The data is then transmitted to the Flask API for processing and predictions.

## 5. Machine Learning Model

### 5.1 Dataset Description
The model is trained on a dataset that includes various health parameters such as temperature, heart rate, activity levels, and sleep patterns.

### 5.2 Model Training Process
1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is cleaned, preprocessed (e.g., normalization, handling missing values), and split into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Selection:** The RandomForestClassifier is chosen as the model due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and provide feature importance insights.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Hyperparameters (e.g., number of trees, tree depth) are tuned using techniques like grid search or cross-validation to optimize model performance.
4. **Model Training:** The model is trained on the training data.
5. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on the testing data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 5.3 Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics to ensure accuracy.

### 5.4 Model Deployment
The trained model is integrated into the Flask API for real-time predictions.

## 6. Flask API

### 6.1 API Structure and Endpoints
The API includes various endpoints:
- `/data`: Receives sensor data from the ESP8266.
- `/predict`: Provides health predictions based on input data.
- `/history`: Retrieves historical health data for a given user.

### 6.2 Integration with Machine Learning Model
The API loads the trained machine learning model and uses it to generate predictions based on the received sensor data.

### 6.3 Data Preprocessing
Sensor data is preprocessed within the API to ensure it is in the correct format for the model (e.g., normalization, handling missing values).

## 7. Flutter Application

### 7.1 User Interface Design

The Flutter app features a user-friendly interface for monitoring health parameters.

### 7.2 Features and Functionality
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Displays live data from sensors (temperature, heart rate, activity).
- **Health Predictions:** Provides real-time health status updates based on API predictions.
- **Historical Data Visualization:** Displays historical health data in charts and graphs.
- **Personalization:** Allows users to set personalized health goals and receive notifications.
- **User Profiles:** Enables multiple users to create and manage their health data.
- **Data Export:** Allows users to export their health data for further analysis or sharing.

### 7.3 Integration with Flask API
The app interacts with the Flask API via HTTP requests to:
- Send sensor data to the API.
- Receive health predictions from the API.
- Fetch historical health data for display.

## 8. System Operation

### 8.1 Starting and Stopping the System
1. **Start the ESP8266:** Power on the ESP8266 and ensure it is connected to the Wi-Fi network.
2. **Start the Flask API:** Run the Flask API server on the chosen hosting environment.
3. **Launch the Flutter App:** Open the Flutter app on the user's device.

### 8.2 API Usage Instructions
The API can be accessed using tools like Postman or cURL to send data and receive predictions.

### 8.3 Interaction with the Flutter App
The app fetches data from the API every 30 seconds and allows manual refreshes.

## 9. Testing

### 9.1 Unit Testing
- Individual components (e.g., sensor drivers, API endpoints, model functions) are tested for correctness and functionality.
- Unit tests are written using appropriate testing frameworks (e.g., pytest for Python).
